Title: Learn a Concept (/learn)

Description: Researches and summarises a programming concept, library or design pattern using authoritative sources, ensuring understanding and avoiding hallucinations.

Steps:

1. **Clarify the topic.** Ask for clarification if the concept is ambiguous. State any assumptions explicitly before researching.

2. **Gather authoritative sources.** Consult official documentation, specifications (PEPs, RFCs), academic papers or reputable tutorials. Avoid relying on unverified blogs or outdated Q&A posts.

3. **Summarise the concept.** Explain what it is, why it’s used, typical use cases and any advantages or disadvantages. Use your own words to ensure comprehension.

4. **Provide an example.** Write a small, complete code example demonstrating the concept. For Python, include type hints and comments. For React, show a simple component. Highlight key lines.

5. **Cite your sources.** Include links or references to the documents or articles consulted. Encourage readers to verify information and read further.

6. **Identify pain points.** Notice where sources differ, documentation is unclear or the concept depends on version‑specific behaviour. Adjust by specifying version numbers and adding tests to verify claims.
