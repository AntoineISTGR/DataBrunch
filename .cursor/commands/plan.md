# plan

Title: Generate Plan (/plan)

Description: Translates a high‑level objective into a structured, step‑by‑step development plan with milestones, deliverables and testing strategy.

Steps:

1. **Define the objective and scope.** Capture what needs to be built or improved, including desired outcomes and constraints (technology choices, performance targets, deadlines). Note what is out of scope to avoid scope creep.

2. **Break work into phases.** Divide the project into logical milestones (e.g., prototype, MVP, full feature). For each phase, list deliverables such as features, documentation, tests or deployments.

3. **Detail tasks.** For each deliverable, outline the tasks required in order of execution. Specify dependencies between tasks and assign responsibilities if team members are known.

4. **Define acceptance criteria.** For each deliverable, specify how success will be measured: passing tests, performance thresholds, user feedback. Include non‑functional requirements (security, accessibility, maintainability).

5. **Plan testing.** Describe the types of tests required (unit, integration, system, performance, security) and when they will be created and executed. Ensure test coverage grows alongside code.

6. **Identify risks and mitigations.** List potential blockers or uncertainties (e.g., integration with an external API, unfamiliar technology). Suggest ways to mitigate them (spikes, prototypes, fallback plans).

7. **Iterate and adjust.** Treat the plan as a living document. As new information surfaces, update tasks and timelines accordingly. Communicate changes to stakeholders.

Pain Points:

- **Unclear objectives** cause poorly aligned plans. Clarify goals early with stakeholders.
- **Overlooking tests** results in poor quality. Ensure testing tasks accompany code tasks.
- **Ignoring risks** leads to delays. Regularly review and update risk mitigation strategies.
